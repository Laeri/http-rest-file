# Http Rest File

This project is a parser and generator for the `.http` and `.rest` file format written in Rust.
The http rest file format describes a request with target, headers and body that can be performed by a api client
for testing purposes.

JetBrains has an inbuilt http client within their editor that can perform these specified requests.
See here for more information: [Intellij Http Syntax](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/exploring-http-syntax.html)

JetBrains also specified the request in editor in the following github project.
[http-request-in-editor-spec](https://github.com/JetBrains/http-request-in-editor-spec)

I am not sure if it is totally accurate right now as the repository has last been updated on February 9th of 2018. 


## Current Status

In progress.
